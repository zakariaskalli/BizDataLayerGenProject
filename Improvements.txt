#### **Enhancements to the Project:**
1. **Error Handling:**  
   - Implement logging in a `TableLog` table within the database.  
   - Generate a JSON file for error tracking and log new errors automatically.  

2. **Query Execution Flexibility:**  
   - Allow users to switch between dynamic SQL queries and stored procedures for all methods.  

#### **Basic Future Improvements:**
1. **Automated Stored Procedure Execution:**  
   - Develop a method to automatically execute all stored procedure files and store the results in the database.  
   - Provide an option in the UI to enable this feature, allowing users to decide whether they want to activate it.  

2. **Customizable Error Handling:**  
   - Offer users the ability to enable or disable error handling via a **Checked List Box** in the UI.  
   - If the user selects **JSON-based logging**, prompt them to install `Newtonsoft.Json` if it is not already available.  

#### **Advanced Future Improvements (Pro Level):**
1. **Multi-threading Optimization:**  
   - Implement multi-threading to speed up the generation of Data Access Layer (DAL) and Business Logic Layer (BL).  

2. **Progress Indicator:**  
   - Add a progress bar to visually track the file generation process.  

3. **Enhanced Documentation and Guidance:**  
   - Automatically insert structured comments for each generated method in DAL and BL to provide usage advice and best practices for developers.
